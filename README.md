## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- npm or yarn
- ArLocal (for local development) or access to Arweave mainnet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishikant23/CurioWeave.git
   cd CurioWeave
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Using ArLocal for Development

1. Install ArLocal:
   ```bash
   npm install -g arlocal
   ```

2. Start ArLocal in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   arlocal
   ```

3. Configure your `.env.local` to use the ArLocal endpoint:
   ```
   VITE_ARWEAVE_URL=http://localhost:1984
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

CurioWeave is built with a modern tech stack:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain Interaction**: arweave-js
- **API Queries**: GraphQL

The application follows a component-based architecture with clean separation of concerns:

- **Components**: UI building blocks
- **Contexts**: State management
- **Services**: API interactions
- **Utils**: Helper functions
- **Hooks**: Reusable logic

## üîÑ Transaction Processing

CurioWeave uses Arweave's GraphQL API to fetch and process transactions. The platform categorizes transactions into several types:

- **Content Upload**: When users upload images, videos, or other content
- **Profile Update**: When users modify their profile information
- **Sent**: Tokens sent to other addresses
- **Received**: Tokens received from other addresses

Each transaction includes metadata stored as tags, which CurioWeave parses and displays in a user-friendly interface.

## üîí Security

- User data is stored on Arweave's permanent and immutable blockchain
- Private keys never leave the user's device
- All interactions with Arweave are performed client-side

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Social features (follow users, like content)
- [ ] Comment system for content engagement
- [ ] Token incentive mechanism
- [ ] Advanced content discovery algorithms
- [ ] Mobile application
